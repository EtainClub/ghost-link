## ⚠️ Concept-First Open Source
**This is not just a codebase. It is a collective hallucination of the future.**

Ghost Link is an open-source experiment to design the **UI/UX of the inevitable**. We know that one day, millions of humans will remotely pilot robots from their living rooms—doing hazardous, skilled, or logistical work via high-fidelity neural links. "Uber for Androids." "DoorDash for Drones."

**The tech isn't here yet. But we are building the interface *now*.**

This repository is a **playground** to imagine, prototype, and debate how that future looks. We are building the dashboard for a job that doesn't exist yet, so that when it does, we set the standard.

## 🚀 Why Star This Repo?
*   **Architect the Future**: Help define the standard interface for telepresence labor.
*   **Vibe Coding Playground**: This is the perfect repo to practice **"Vibe Coding"**. Use AI (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot) to generate wild UI concepts, futuristic dashboards, and interactive prototypes.
*   **No "Real" Backend Required**: We focus on the *experience*. Mock data is our friend. Visuals are our currency.
*   **Reserve Your Spot**: Early contributors are the founding architects of the Ghost Link protocol.

## 🛠 How to Contribute
We don't need optimized SQL queries. We need **Ideas**.

1.  **Vibe Code**: Ask your AI to "Make the VR HUD look more cyberpunk" or "Add a haptic feedback visualizer." Submit the PR.
2.  **Concept Art in Code**: Use React/Tailwind/Three.js to build stunning, futuristic interfaces.
3.  **Roleplay Issues**: Open issues like *"Glitch in neural link latency display"* or *"need authentication flow for Class-5 Hazmat droids"*. Treat the fiction as real.

## 🔮 The Vision
Imagine a world where:
*   A surgeon in Tokyo repairs a pipeline in Alaska.
*   A gamer in Brazil controls a construction bot on the Moon.
*   You earn crypto yields for every second of motor skill you rent out.

**Ghost Link is the bridge.**

## Tech Stack (For Now)
*   **Next.js 16** (App Router)
*   **Tailwind CSS** (v4)
*   **Vibe Coding** (LLMs welcome)
